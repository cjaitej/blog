        I am Jaitej, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science at
        Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) in Hyderabad, with
        a strong academic record represented by a Cumulative Grade Point Average
        (CGPA) of 9.23. This underscores my commitment to academic excellence
        and a robust foundation in computer science. As extracurricular
        activity, I serve as a tech lead at Disha club within GITAM Hyderabad,
        where I actively engage in leadership roles and technical
        responsibilities. Furthermore, my interests extend beyond my academic
        and professional pursuits. I am passionate about AI/ML (Artificial
        Intelligence and Machine Learning) and web development, and I eagerly
        explore these fields to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and
        technologies. Outside of the tech world, I enjoy a range of hobbies,
        including listening to music, watching movies, and playing cricket.
        These hobbies provide a well-rounded balance to my academic and
        professional commitments, allowing me to enjoy a diverse array of
        activities in my leisure time.
